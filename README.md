# push2Storage
Package to upload files to cloud storage such as s3. Will be adding support for other cloud storage as well.  

## Need for this
Even though there are other packages which do the same thing but I thought of having a one simple function which can be used to upload the files to the cloud storage. 


## Steps to Use

- Import the "github.com/ayush5588/push2Storage/pkg/upload" pkg.  
- Pass the required arguments to the upload.Upload() function. 

For full example, please see the examples folder. 

## Current cloud storage implementations
 - S3 (AWS)
